# Static vs Instance

## Static methods
* Declared using a static modifier
* Can't access instanace methods and instance variables directly
* Static methods are usually used for operations that don't require any data from an instance of the class(from 'this')
* 'This' keyword is the current instance of a class
    * Can't use 'this' keyword in static method 
* Method that doesn't use instance variables that method should be declared as a static method     

## Instance methods  
* Belong to an instance of a class
* To use an instance method, we have to instantiate the class first usually by using the 'new' keyword
* Instance methods can access instance methods and instance variables directly
* Can also access static methods and static variables directly

## Static Variables
* Declared by using the keyword static 
* Static variables are also known as static member variables
* Every instance of that class shares the same static variable
* When reading user input using Scanner, declare scanner as static variable 

## Instance Variables
* Don't use the static keyword
* Instance variables are also known as fields or member variables
* Belong to an instance of a class 
* Every instance has it's own cpy of an instance variable
* Can have a different value(state)
* Represent the state of an instance
